# Classification-implementations
A project of implementing simple well-known classification algorithms from scratch with Python, Numpy and Pandas
The instruction to run the code is straight-forward. Respectively:
1. Import libraires
2. Run the code for splitting datasets into training set and test set
3. Run the algorithm that you want
